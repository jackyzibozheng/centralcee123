            "I loved you until you try to get in my head
            And that's why I lost respect
            You're doin' the most to get my attention, baby, I'm not impressed, uh
            I changed my bedsheets, but I still smell your flesh
            I don't know how we got in this mess
            I rarely get this in-depth
            This girl make me question love
            This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
            Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us
            The last time that we fucked was fucked, the way you got up, got dressed and cut
            Look, I thought that we could've been
            Maybe, I was too optimistic
            Tell me what you need, I'll provide everythin'
            Baby, you don't know what you're missin'
            Our chemistry felt like quantum physics, physics
            Feelin' your energy, feelin' your spirit
            If this is the end, I need one more visit
            They're showin' me love, but I still feel empty
            I need somethin' a lot more fulfillin', uh
            Move out of London town then move to a rural village
            You made me delete that pic off my phone
            But I close my eyes, still see that image
            Won't chase if my heart ain't in it, it's finished
            Too far gone, can't fix it, bitch, this damage is done" - Central Cee
