            "There was a time when I was alone
            Nowhere to go and no place to call home
            My only friend was the man in the moon
            And even, sometimes, he would go away too
            
            I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored, we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
Chasing money, have to get that bag (That bag)
I've been checking my phone connection
Shaky, man I got that lag (Man, I do)
Been preein' the Insta' previews
It's funny, man, that shit so bad (Haha)
Just chill man and be yourself
You ain't that guy, you ain't that lad (You ain’t)
Seventeen and I havе that dream
I'mma chase my goals and I'll make it happеn
You said you don’t believe in me
It's cool, it's calm, I know you cappin’ (It's cap)
Home alone, tryna make this bread
Legally, I don't need no trappin' (No trappin’)
Ninety-nine plus in the notice, huh?
I don't even know what's happening" - Prinz
