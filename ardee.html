            "ArrDee, ArrDee
            Come and you go
            Can't trust a soul, no
            Story of my life
            Look, uh
            In this world, you come and you go (go)
            Story of my life
            I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
            Not gettin' by but it's all timing
            I don't mind it, it's alright
            However you cope
            When you live in a place so cold
            Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
            'Cause in this world, you come and you go (go)
            Story of my life
            I've been on my ones, I'm grinding
            Not gettin' by but it's all timing
            I don't mind it, it's alright
            However you cope
            When you live in a place so cold
            Hearts get froze, I don't trust a soul
            Started from young and the kid ain't grown
            But the problem have, I hardly did know my dad
            But it weren't his fault, I'm no longer mad
            He does what he can, they come and they go (always)
            The first girl that I had still fucks with my mind
            But the girl is a ho
            But now I'm trash so what do you know
            I cum and I go, literally
            They all show love on the road
            And I got all the bad girls tryna get pics with me
            If I step in the club then they sit with me (come)
            It's a blessing I ain't gonna bitch, but see
            I bet you now they wouldn't stick with me (facts)
            If I didn't rock this flow
            If I didn't pop then blow but I chose this" - Central Cee
